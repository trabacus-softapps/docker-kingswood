Pentaho - OpenERP Report Integration by Willow IT
=================================================
This module integrates Pentaho's reporting engine with OpenERP.

This project was developed by Willow IT, using the libraries and extensions developed by De Bortoli Wines,
Australia (Pieter van der Merwe in particular) for the Pentaho reporting system. The OpenERP addon also derives
from and/or is inspired by the Jasper Reports addon developed by NaN-tic.

Willow IT contributions:

* Deepak Seshadri - OpenERP-Pentaho server connector (Java)

* Richard deMeester - frontend and core functions, automated wizard and action implementation

* Douglas Parker - additional integration

* Jon Wilson - inspiration, testing, and whipping


Report Designer and Java Component
----------------------------------
For notes on installing and running the report designer, 3.9, refer to:
    **http://bit.ly/L4wPoC**

Report designer version 5.0 includes the OpenERP datasource. It can be installed and used without the need for
additional components.

The README document contains instructions relevant to building and running the java component.


Report Types
------------
Broadly speaking, two types of data sources can be used to produce the reports. OpenERP object data sources or SQL
query data sources.

* Object data sources have the advantage that they can use OpenERP model columns, even those that are not stored
  in the database. This includes functional fields, related fields, properties. They can iterate through one2many
  and many2many subfields. They also respect OpenERP record rules.

* SQL data sources have the advantage that they allow greater flexibility in selections, and other SQL features
  like grouping and selective inclusion of sub-queries. It also allows selection where no OpenERP model
  relationship exists. It does not respect OpenERP record rules, which may be seen as an advantage for creating
  summary type reports which may be run by users who may not be able to view low-level data. Because of this, you
  need to be careful.


Report Parameters
-----------------
Prompted and hidden parameters are supported, as are mandatory values.

A number of reserved parameters are automatically passed, but the report needs to define these parameters in order
to receive and use them. Reserved parameters currently passed are:

* *ids*: the context ids when the report action is called. This is almost always needed for object based reports
  to be meaningful.
* *user_id*: the id of the user running the report.
* *user_name*: the display name of the user running the report.
* *context_lang*: the language in effect when the report action is executed.
* *context_tz*: the timezone in effect when the report action is executed.

This list of reserved parameters is available for use is all data sources, even those which return possible
parameter selections, thereby allow meaningful selections for other parameters.

Most Pentaho report parameter types and features have been mapped, where practicable, to something which makes
sense to an OpenERP environment. This means that a number of Java data types don't necessarily differentiate.
For example, (Integer / Long / Short / BigInteger / et al) will all be treated as integers.

Default values can be passed for the parameters, and may default value formulae work.

Hidden parameters must obviously receive and work with a default value of some sort. This default can be the
Pentaho default, or can be sent to the report in the context in the format:
    **{'pentaho_defaults': { .... }}**

where the passed dictionary contains the parameter names as keys. See below for guidance on where to set this up.

Pentaho Display Types have been consolidated.  Drop Down, Single Value List, etc, all display as OpenERP selection
pull downs. Pentaho multi value selection types, such as Multi Value List, Check Box, etc, are implemented as
single value selection pull downs. Date Picker uses the standard OpenERP date/time widget.

Other Pentaho parameter features should be considered unsupported, such as Post-Processing Formula, Display Value
Formula, Visible Items, Validate Values, et al.


Setup
-----
Some parameters may be required in Settings/Customization/System Parameters.

The address of the Pentaho server which is used to render the report is defined with the parameter:
    **pentaho.server.url**

For object based data sources, the Pentaho server will use XML-RPC to connect to the current database using the
interface and port as defined in the OpenERP config file, and the reporting user's credentials.

If not defined in the config file, the interface and port can be defined with the parameters:

* pentaho.openerp.xml.interface
* pentaho.openerp.xml.port

For SQL query based data sources, the Pentaho server will use the following parameters:

* pentaho.postgres.host
* pentaho.postgres.port
* pentaho.postgres.login
* pentaho.postgres.password


Report Actions
--------------
Reports are defined to OpenERP under **Settings/Technical/Low Level Objects/Actions/Reports**.  This is the place
where standard OpenERP report actions are defined. Selecting the appropriate checkbox can convert existing report
actions to Pentaho Report Actions.

Reports can be handled by OpenERP in two ways. They can be linked to a menu, or they can be linked to a model.

* Model linked reports will appear in the right hand toolbar as per standard reports, or they can be specifically
  called with an action, such as a button. A record or number of records needs to be selected before the action
  will be invoked, and the ids of the selected records will be passed to the report as a list parameter called
  "ids". A report invoked this way will not prompt for any additional parameters. A front end custom wizard can be
  created if desired to invoke the action, but that wizard and the report would be very closely tied and need to
  be developed in conjunction with one other.

* Menu linked reports will appear somewhere in a menu. They will pop up a window prompting for a report output
  type, and any additional (visible) parameters that are defined. Object ids passed to these reports are not
  meaningful, as no object or ids are guaranteed to be in effect when the action is called, so selection of data
  needs to be based on other parameters. Other reserved parameters, such as user id, may be meaningful in the
  context of prompting for parameters or ultimate data selection.

Report actions can override existing OpenERP actions (such as invoice prints) or can be new actions.

The service name is only important if it is overriding an existing service, or if the report is to be invoked from
coded actions like buttons or wizards. For menu linked actions or generic object linked actions, the service name
is incidental.

Output types specified here are defaults, and can be overridden by either a custom wizard or by menu linked
reports. They will not be changeable for model linked reports which don't have specific coding.

The prpt (Pentaho report definition) file selected is stored in the database. Changing the report using the
designer will require the report to be re-loaded.

A prpt file and action can easily be defined as part of a module and distributed this way. Be aware, though, if
the module is upgraded from within OpenERP it could potentially reload the distributed report and may lose
changes that were uploaded manually after module installation.

Security groups entered against the action will be respected in regard to action visibility - they play no role in
the report execution.

If a context value is required to set a default value, it needs to be set against the created action. It comes up
under Settings/Customization/Low Level Actions/Actions/Window Actions. It will already have a Context Value with
the service_name defined, which should be left intact.


Disclaimer
----------
This has been developed over time to meet specific requirements as we have needed to meet them. If something is
wrong, or you think would make a great feature, please do let us know at:

Library
-------
We will be endeavouring to create a library of sample and useful reports. Check at:
    **http://www.willowit.com.au/**

where we will announce when and where this is available. In the meantime, if you develop any reports or templates
that you would consider worth sharing, please email them through with some description or details.
